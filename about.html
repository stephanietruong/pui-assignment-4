                    Bun Bun Bake Shop was started 10 years ago as a result of Stephanie's passion for baking. She loved eating the classic cinnamon rolls her grandma used to make for her as a child. She decided to use her imagination to add different or even sometimes odd ingredients into the classic cinnamon roll to create a new flavor. 
                    <br><br>
                    We started out with baking cinnamon rolls from our own kitchen and shipping it world-wide. Two years ago, we were able to have a physical location. We now have a small bakery that specializes in cinnamon rolls but we have also tried to expand our product lines. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our shop is located in Pittsburgh, PA, but we still continue to ship fresh rolls to anywhere in the USA. <br><br>
